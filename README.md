So hey guys, I’m learning AI & ML by building some data science stuff, and I’d love some feedback if you can!
# CSV to Graph 📊✨

**Turn boring CSV files into snazzy graphs in seconds!**

---

## What is this? 🤔

Ever stared at a CSV and thought, *“Wow… this is the peak of excitement”*? Yeah… me neither.
This Python app fixes that. Feed it a CSV (your own or one of the example files included), and boom—beautiful graphs that actually make your data look like it’s doing something.

---

## Features 🚀

* Upload **your own CSV** or use **example CSVs** we provide.
* Generate **line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots**.
* **Interactive UI**—because who wants to do everything in the terminal?
* Built with pure Python and a sprinkle of ChatGPT magic 💫.

## Example CSV Source 🗂

I grabbed some juicy CSVs from [Stats NZ](https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/) to test the app. You can use those or any CSV you want.

## Tech Stack 💻

* Python 3.x
* Pandas (for all that CSV wrangling)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for graphing vibes)
* Tkinter (because GUI matters)

## Credits & Shoutouts 🙌

* ChatGPT for some guidance (don’t tell anyone I cheated a little 😎)
* Official docs for Pandas, CustomTkinter and Matplotlib
* Stats NZ for the CSVs

## TL;DR 📝

CSV → Upload → Graph → Instant flex.
